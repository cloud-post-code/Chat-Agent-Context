# Agent behavior

How the visitor-facing agent (`lib/brain.ts`) decides what to say. Update this
file whenever prompts, tools or routing change.

## Turn flow

1. **Canned answer?** A matching `CannedAnswer` with a card attached (or on a
   channel that can't draw cards) is served as-is, zero model calls. Without a
   card it becomes the model's script (`APPROVED ANSWER`).
2. **Prompt** (`lib/knowledge.ts`): persona core + `KNOWLEDGE FOR THIS
   QUESTION`, one retrieval keyed on the visitor's message
   (`lib/retrieval/search.ts`): stemmed BM25 + same-model cosine, source titles
   scored, one-hop graph expansion. Small multi-chunk sources (a price list)
   are served whole.
3. **Tools**: catalog cards (`show_projects`, `show_project`, `show_gallery`,
   `show_contact_form`, `show_card`), `show_booking` when booking is on, and
   `search_knowledge` on every unscripted turn.
4. **Loop**: up to 4 model turns; tool results are fed back so the model can
   close.

## search_knowledge

The model's second look at the knowledge base, in its own words. The
`LOOKING THINGS UP` prompt section lists the knowledge sections and requires a
search before telling a visitor something is unavailable. Results go to the
model only. Not offered on scripted turns.

## Answer rules

Facts only from the prompt or a search. Lead with what is known; when the exact
thing isn't listed, give the closest related facts and name the gap; asked for
everything, give the full list. Then, and only then, hand off to the owner.

## Onboarding: the booking form

The services extractor (`lib/onboarding/services.ts`, `SERVICES_SYSTEM_PROMPT`)
also reads the business's own booking page, offsite widgets included
(`=== BOOKING PAGE <url>`), and reports the booking `kind`, `staff` a customer
can ask for (kept only when the name is in the text read), whether `phone` /
`email` are asked, and `notes`. It is told not to report the service choice or
the date and time as requirements. `lib/bookingFormPlan.ts` turns those facts
into the questions — no model call; site evidence beats the per-kind norm —
and `rebuildUntouchedForm` writes them only over a form nobody has edited.
Checked live against a real booking page by
`docs/features/booking-form-planner/crosscheck.ts`.

## Site-cards agent: A2UI cards from the imported site

The A2UI tab's "Build cards from my site" button runs `buildCardsFromSite`
(`lib/siteCards.ts`, `SITE_CARDS_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) over
`POST /api/admin/site-cards` (NDJSON: `status` / `need` / `card`, then one
`done` or `error`). It reads the site the business imported — the tenant's
link `Source` rows, no crawling — beside an `EXISTING CARDS` block and the
onboarding planner's BUSINESS / SIGNALS / STARTER QUESTIONS blocks. One
planning call names up to 4 visitor **needs**, each with the page URL it was
read from and the card that serves it (`gallery`, `services`, `contact`,
`projects`, `designed`; never `booking`). `sanitizeSiteCardPlan` drops a need
the catalog already covers (same tool for a live-data card, same label for any
card) before the onboarding sanitizer's gates and caps. Cards are placed
through onboarding's `placeCard`: designed ones go to the research-enabled card
builder (`draftUiCard`) with the need and its evidence page added to the brief.
Strictly additive — rows append after the catalog's last, existing rows are
never touched, new cards attach only to starter questions with no card. No
imported site means no model call. Designed cards need a builder model that
supports adaptive thinking (`CARD_BUILDER_MODEL`). Proof:
`docs/features/site-driven-a2ui-cards/proof.ts`; live check: `crosscheck.ts`
beside it.

## Admin copilot: focused edits

The admin copilot (`lib/adminBrain.ts`, `/admin/chat`) has `show_panel`,
`save_goal`, `propose_ingestion`, and `propose_theme_color {role, value}`. Its
system prompt carries the account's current theme colors by role (stored value
or fallback) and says the page name renders in the `text` role, so "make the
accent the color of the name" resolves to a hex. Asked for a color change it can
work out, it calls `propose_theme_color` instead of opening the Theme panel: the
chat shows only that color's editor, pre-filled (`edit` event → `ThemeEditCard`),
and nothing is written until the admin clicks Save (`applyThemeColorAction` →
`applyThemeColor`, which merges one role and leaves the rest of the theme alone).
A color it cannot derive gets one question or the full panel — never a guess.
The `edit` event names its `panel` so other panels can add slices later. Proof:
`docs/features/copilot-focused-edits/proof.ts`.

## Testing

`docs/features/dynamic-knowledge-answers/` — the question set (`questions.ts`),
offline proof, and `--live` answer eval.
